ogre
====
A simple Ogre Battle clone written in C++ and SFML.  Learning as I go.

Objective
---------
Win by controlling all the towns or causing your opponent to spend all their money.  Don't run of your your money!

Strategy
--------
Send your strong units to towns to keep them from your opponent and collect taxes.  Faster units may be good for snatching out of the way towns.  Every 100 steps, you must pay your units, but you also get to collect taxes from towns.  Don't run out of money!

Unit strength is listed next to the unit.  Getting close to an enemy unit will cause them to fight, wounding both but sending the loser backwards (this is how you can take over a town with an occupant).

Deploy new units (anywhere!) if you got the extra funds and need more soldiers.  Your enemy will do the same as her units bounce from town to town.

Controls
--------
* Space Bar - Pause the game
* Left Click - Select unit/issue move command
* Right Click - Deploy unit
* Esc - Quit
